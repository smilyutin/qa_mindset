**Concepts to Carry, Not Certifications to Chase**

---

## Overview
Six Sigma is often misunderstood as statistics, belts, or bureaucracy.  
In reality, it is a **way of thinking about systems, variation, and improvement**.

This module captures Six Sigma as a **set of mental models** — ideas you can apply naturally when working in QA, engineering, operations, or leadership.

No formulas. No tools. Just concepts.

---

## Intent of This Module
This module is meant to:
- Refresh core Six Sigma thinking
- Provide mental shortcuts for real-world problems
- Help you recognize Six Sigma situations when they appear
- Stay useful even if you never pursue certification

---

## Mental Model 1: Variation Is the Enemy
If something works:
- Sometimes
- Under specific conditions
- For certain people only

…it is **not reliable**.

Variation creates:
- Flaky tests
- Intermittent bugs
- “Works on my machine”
- Surprise incidents

Six Sigma trains you to **hunt variation**, not defects alone.

---

## Mental Model 2: Output Reflects the System
Results come from systems, not individuals.

If problems repeat:
- The system allows them
- The process tolerates them
- The incentives reward them

Blame hides root causes.  
Systems create outcomes.

---

## Mental Model 3: Define Problems Precisely
Vague problems cannot be solved.

Bad definition:
> “Quality is bad”

Precise definition:
> “Transaction reconciliation fails ~2–3% of the time when retries occur”

Clarity creates leverage.

---

## Mental Model 4: Symptoms Are Not Causes
Fixing symptoms feels productive.
Fixing causes prevents recurrence.

If a problem returns:
- The cause was not removed
- Or was misunderstood

Six Sigma favors **why** over **what**.

---

## Mental Model 5: Measure Before You Act
Human intuition is unreliable.

Six Sigma teaches:
- Observe first
- Measure second
- Act last

Even rough data beats confident guessing.

---

## Mental Model 6: Patterns Matter More Than Incidents
One failure may be noise.  
Repeated failures are signal.

Six Sigma thinking looks for:
- Trends
- Clusters
- Recurrence
- Drift

Patterns tell the truth systems hide.

---

## Mental Model 7: Small Percentages Still Matter
A 1–3% failure rate sounds small.

At scale, it becomes:
- Thousands of failures
- Customer distrust
- Financial loss
- Regulatory exposure

Six Sigma respects low-probability, high-impact risk.

---

## Mental Model 8: Root Causes Beat Quick Fixes
Quick fixes reduce pain today.
Root fixes reduce pain permanently.

If a fix requires:
- Constant attention
- Manual checks
- Heroics

…it is not a real fix.

---

## Mental Model 9: Improvements Must Survive Time
A solution is not real unless it:
- Survives pressure
- Survives deadlines
- Survives team changes

Durability defines improvement.

---

## Mental Model 10: Control Prevents Regression
Control is not bureaucracy.

Control means:
- Visibility
- Ownership
- Feedback
- Alerts
- Boundaries

If a fix can regress silently, it will.

---

## Mental Model 11: Stability Enables Speed
Chaos feels fast.
Stability *is* fast.

Stable systems:
- Require less rework
- Produce fewer surprises
- Move faster over time

Six Sigma optimizes for **predictable speed**.

---

## Mental Model 12: Focus on the Vital Few
Most problems come from a small number of causes.

Fixing everything fixes nothing.
Fixing the biggest driver changes everything.

This is the 80/20 mindset.

---

## Mental Model 13: Systems Drift Without Attention
Processes decay naturally.

Without feedback:
- Workarounds grow
- Shortcuts normalize
- Risk accumulates

Six Sigma assumes **entropy** unless proven otherwise.

---

## Mental Model 14: Improvement Is Iterative
There is no final state.

Six Sigma thinking is:
- Observe
- Learn
- Adjust
- Repeat

This aligns naturally with Agile and continuous improvement.

---

## Mental Model 15: Quality Is a Risk Decision
Perfection is not the goal.
Understanding risk is.

Six Sigma reframes quality as:
> “Do we understand the variation well enough to proceed?”

---

## Mental Model 16: Visibility Reduces Fear
Hidden problems feel dangerous.
Visible problems feel manageable.

Six Sigma favors:
- Dashboards
- Signals
- Transparency

Fear thrives in darkness.

---

## Mental Model 17: Prevention Beats Detection
Detecting defects is necessary.
Preventing them is cheaper.

Six Sigma prioritizes:
- Early validation
- Clear inputs
- Stable processes

Late fixes are expensive fixes.

---

## Mental Model 18: Human Behavior Follows Incentives
People optimize for what is rewarded.

If speed is rewarded:
- Quality erodes

If silence is rewarded:
- Risk hides

Six Sigma aligns incentives with outcomes.

---

## Mental Model 19: Evidence Builds Trust
Opinions trigger debate.
Evidence enables decisions.

Six Sigma prefers:
- Observable facts
- Repeatable measurements
- Clear trends

Trust grows from consistency.

---

## Mental Model 20: Control ≠ Control Freak
Control is not micromanagement.

Good control:
- Enables autonomy
- Reduces cognitive load
- Prevents surprises

Bad control adds friction.

---

## Mental Model 21: Not All Problems Are Equal
Some problems:
- Annoy
Others:
- Break trust
- Violate regulation
- Cause financial harm

Six Sigma prioritizes by **impact**, not noise.

---

## Mental Model 22: Local Optimization Can Hurt the Whole
Fixing one area can break another.

Six Sigma thinks in:
- End-to-end flows
- System boundaries
- Downstream effects

Local wins can cause global loss.

---

## Mental Model 23: Learning Beats Blame
Blame ends learning.
Learning prevents recurrence.

Six Sigma treats failure as:
- Information
- Feedback
- Input for improvement

Psychological safety improves quality.

---

## Mental Model 24: Rework Is Invisible Waste
Rework hides inside:
- Bug fixes
- Retesting
- Clarifications
- Firefighting

Six Sigma exposes rework to reduce it.

---

## Mental Model 25: Consistency Builds Confidence
Confidence comes from:
- Predictability
- Repeatability
- Transparency

Not from optimism.

---

## Mental Model 26: Complex Systems Fail Quietly
Big failures start small.

Six Sigma watches for:
- Early warning signals
- Minor anomalies
- Near misses

Silence is not safety.

---

## Mental Model 27: Improvement Is a Leadership Responsibility
Without leadership support:
- Fixes fade
- Controls weaken
- Drift returns

Six Sigma improvement requires ownership.

---

## Mental Model 28: Fixing One Root Cause Is Enough
You don’t need to fix everything.

Removing one dominant cause can:
- Collapse failure rates
- Stabilize systems
- Restore trust

Precision beats volume.

---

## Mental Model 29: Six Sigma Is About Thinking, Not Math
Statistics support thinking.
They do not replace it.

You can practice Six Sigma daily without formulas.

---

## Mental Model 30: Reduce Surprise
Ultimately, Six Sigma reduces surprise.

Fewer surprises means:
- Fewer incidents
- Better decisions
- Lower stress
- Higher trust

---

## Final Summary
> **Six Sigma is disciplined curiosity applied to systems instead of people.**

Carry these models with you.  
Apply them when the pain appears.  
That is Six Sigma in practice.
