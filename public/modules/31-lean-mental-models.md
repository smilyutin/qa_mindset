**Flow Over Effort, Value Over Activity**

---

## Overview
Lean is often misunderstood as “doing more with less” or “cutting costs.”
In reality, Lean is about **removing waste so value can flow smoothly**.

Lean does not ask:
> “How do we work harder?”

Lean asks:
> “Why is this work necessary at all?”

This module captures Lean as a set of **mental models you can apply anywhere** — QA, engineering, product, operations, or leadership.

---

## Intent of This Module
This module exists to:
- Refresh Lean thinking without jargon
- Provide practical mental shortcuts
- Help you recognize waste in real systems
- Complement Six Sigma thinking (flow + stability)

---

## Mental Model 1: Value Is Defined by the Customer
If the customer wouldn’t pay for it, it is not value.

Internal effort, complexity, and heroics do not count.
Only outcomes matter.

---

## Mental Model 2: Everything Else Is Waste
Lean defines waste as:
> Anything that does not directly create customer value.

Waste is often invisible because it feels “normal.”

---

## Mental Model 3: The Eight Wastes (Expanded)
Classic Lean waste categories include:
- Overproduction
- Waiting
- Handoffs
- Overprocessing
- Inventory
- Motion
- Defects
- Unused talent

In modern software, these show up constantly.

---

## Mental Model 4: Work in Progress Is the Enemy
The more work in progress:
- The slower everything becomes
- The harder it is to finish anything
- The more defects hide

Lean favors **finishing over starting**.

---

## Mental Model 5: Flow Beats Utilization
Busy teams are not productive teams.

Lean optimizes for:
- Smooth flow
- Predictable delivery
- Short feedback loops

Idle time is less harmful than blocked flow.

---

## Mental Model 6: Waiting Is Invisible Waste
Waiting hides in:
- Reviews
- Approvals
- Dependencies
- Queues

If work is waiting, value is not flowing.

---

## Mental Model 7: Handoffs Create Loss
Every handoff introduces:
- Context loss
- Delay
- Misunderstanding
- Errors

Lean prefers **fewer boundaries and clearer ownership**.

---

## Mental Model 8: Batch Size Amplifies Pain
Large batches:
- Hide defects
- Delay feedback
- Increase risk

Lean favors **small, reversible changes**.

---

## Mental Model 9: Feedback Must Be Fast
The longer feedback takes:
- The more expensive fixes become
- The more context is lost
- The higher the risk

Lean compresses feedback loops relentlessly.

---

## Mental Model 10: Make Problems Visible
Hidden problems do not get fixed.

Lean systems surface:
- Blockers
- Bottlenecks
- Defects
- Delays

Visibility reduces fear and finger-pointing.

---

## Mental Model 11: Stop Starting, Start Finishing
Starting work feels productive.
Finishing work delivers value.

Lean limits WIP to force completion.

---

## Mental Model 12: Local Optimization Breaks Systems
Optimizing one team can slow the whole system.

Lean thinking is end-to-end, not silo-based.

---

## Mental Model 13: Simplicity Scales, Complexity Tax Accumulates
Every workaround adds tax.
Every exception adds friction.

Lean favors:
- Simple paths
- Clear rules
- Predictable behavior

---

## Mental Model 14: Standardization Enables Improvement
Standard work:
- Creates baselines
- Enables learning
- Prevents reinvention

Standardization is not rigidity — it’s clarity.

---

## Mental Model 15: Build Quality In, Don’t Inspect It In
Late inspection is expensive.

Lean prefers:
- Clear inputs
- Early validation
- Prevention over detection

---

## Mental Model 16: Delay Is a Decision
If something is delayed, someone chose that outcome.

Lean treats delays as design decisions, not accidents.

---

## Mental Model 17: Context Switching Is Waste
Multitasking feels efficient.
It destroys focus and flow.

Lean protects focus by limiting concurrent work.

---

## Mental Model 18: Ownership Reduces Waste
Ambiguity creates delays.

Lean systems have:
- Clear ownership
- Clear decision paths
- Clear accountability

---

## Mental Model 19: Visual Systems Beat Status Reports
Lean favors:
- Boards
- Signals
- Visual indicators

If you need a meeting to know status, the system is weak.

---

## Mental Model 20: Rework Is Silent Waste
Rework hides inside:
- Bug fixes
- Clarifications
- Retesting
- Re-approvals

Lean exposes rework so it can be eliminated.

---

## Mental Model 21: Queue Length Predicts Delay
Long queues guarantee long wait times.

Lean manages queues aggressively.

---

## Mental Model 22: Small Improvements Compound
Lean favors:
- Continuous improvement
- Small changes
- Frequent learning

Big transformations often fail; steady improvement sticks.

---

## Mental Model 23: Respect for People Is Core
Lean does not optimize machines — it supports people.

Respect means:
- Reducing frustration
- Removing obstacles
- Listening to those doing the work

---

## Mental Model 24: Waste Feels Normal Until You See It
Once waste is visible, it becomes unbearable.

Lean trains the eye to see inefficiency everywhere.

---

## Mental Model 25: Constraints Define Throughput
A system moves at the speed of its slowest step.

Lean focuses improvement at bottlenecks.

---

## Mental Model 26: Automation Can Multiply Waste
Automating a broken process makes failure faster.

Lean fixes flow first, then automates.

---

## Mental Model 27: Decision Latency Is Waste
Slow decisions block flow just as much as slow code.

Lean shortens decision paths.

---

## Mental Model 28: Silence Is a Smell
If no issues are reported:
- People may be afraid
- Problems may be hidden
- Feedback loops may be broken

Lean systems encourage speaking up.

---

## Mental Model 29: Lean Is a Daily Practice
Lean is not a project.
It is how work is done every day.

---

## Mental Model 30: Lean and Six Sigma Are Complements
Lean improves **flow**.
Six Sigma reduces **variation**.

Together, they create stable, fast systems.

---

## Mental Model 31: Reduce Friction
Lean’s ultimate goal is simple:
> Reduce friction between intent and outcome.

---

## Final Summary
**Lean is the discipline of removing everything that slows value from reaching the customer.**

Once you see waste, you can’t unsee it.
That is Lean.
