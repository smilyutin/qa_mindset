 
**Flow vs Stability — Two Ways to Improve the Same System**

---

## Overview
Lean and Six Sigma are often presented as competing methodologies.  
In reality, they solve **different problems** and are most powerful when used together.

- **Lean** removes waste and improves flow
- **Six Sigma** reduces variation and defects

Same goal. Different lenses.

---

## The Core Difference (One Sentence Each)

- **Lean asks:** Why does this take so long?
- **Six Sigma asks:** Why does this fail sometimes?

---

## Primary Focus

| Aspect | Lean | Six Sigma |
|-----|------|-----------|
| Main goal | Faster flow | Predictable outcomes |
| Primary enemy | Waste | Variation |
| Key question | Is this step necessary? | Why does this vary? |
| Outcome | Speed and efficiency | Stability and reliability |

## How They Think About Problems

### Lean Thinking
- Too many steps
- Too much waiting
- Too many handoffs
- Too much work in progress

Lean assumes:
> The system is slow because it is clogged.

---

### Six Sigma Thinking
- Inconsistent results
- Intermittent failures
- Repeated incidents
- Flaky behavior

Six Sigma assumes:
> The system is unstable because variation is unmanaged.

---

## Typical Signals to Use Each

### When Lean Is the Right Lens
- Long lead times
- Too many approvals
- Constant context switching
- Work stuck in queues
- “We’re busy but nothing finishes”

---

### When Six Sigma Is the Right Lens
- Recurring defects
- Flaky tests
- Data mismatches
- Intermittent production issues
- “It fails only sometimes”

---

## Lean in Software & QA
Lean shows up as:
- Smaller batches
- Earlier feedback
- Reduced handoffs
- Clear ownership
- Limiting WIP

Lean helps QA by:
- Reducing rework
- Shortening feedback loops
- Making problems visible earlier

---

## Six Sigma in Software & QA
Six Sigma shows up as:
- Root cause analysis
- Defect trend analysis
- Stabilizing environments
- Eliminating flaky behavior
- Strengthening controls

Six Sigma helps QA by:
- Preventing repeat incidents
- Increasing trust in test signals
- Improving release confidence

---

## Common Misuses

### Misusing Lean
- Cutting steps without understanding risk
- Removing checks that catch real failures
- Confusing speed with quality

---

### Misusing Six Sigma
- Over-measuring everything
- Analysis paralysis
- Adding controls that slow flow unnecessarily

---

## How They Work Best Together

Lean without Six Sigma:
- Fast but fragile

Six Sigma without Lean:
- Stable but slow

**Lean + Six Sigma:**
- Fast *and* predictable

---

## A Simple Combined Mental Model

1. Use **Lean** to:
   - Remove unnecessary steps
   - Improve flow
   - Shorten feedback loops

2. Use **Six Sigma** to:
   - Stabilize critical paths
   - Eliminate recurring failures
   - Control variation

---

## Example (QA Context)

- Lean question:
  > Why does regression take 5 days?

- Six Sigma question:
  > Why does regression fail inconsistently?

Both are valid.  
Both are necessary.

---

## Leadership Perspective

- Lean helps leaders see **where time is wasted**
- Six Sigma helps leaders see **where risk hides**

Together, they support better decisions.

---

## Key Takeaways
- Lean and Six Sigma are complementary
- Lean improves flow; Six Sigma improves stability
- Use Lean for speed problems
- Use Six Sigma for reliability problems
- Mature teams apply both naturally

---

## Final Thought
> **Lean removes friction.  
> Six Sigma removes surprise.  
> Great systems remove both.**
